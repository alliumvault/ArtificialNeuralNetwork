# ArtificialNeuralNetwork ("MyNet")

This app uses artificial neural networks to recognize numbers, arithmetic symbols (currently supported: +, -, *, /) and motives on a color image (currently supported: landscape, window from the inside, forest, flower, document, fire, sunset).
The subject/motive recognition only works with images and weights in the right folders. Weights for the recognition of numbers and arithmetic symbols are included in the assets of the app.

The app is avaiable in english, german and norwegian.
